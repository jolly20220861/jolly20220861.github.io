# About
**Jolly's Homepage** is a documentation of the learning I gained from **IT5016 Software Development Fundamentals**. A weekly reflection journal is created to train and practice my programming knowledge.  At the same time monitor my progress while creating a reference for future use as I advance in my developing skills.  This is also intended to be of help to aspiring developers who are just starting their journey.  It's my pleasure to pay it forward by sharing the mastery I have acquired and be part of your success in one way or another.

Please don't hesitate to check out my weekly improvement and share with me your thoughts.
