_I used to say I'm too old for school but life seems so boring doing the same routine. My heart leads me back to where I am passionate about; not programming, not computers but what lies within; discovery and understanding. I realised that, as we age, we need to continue to improve and develop ourselves. Technology is the future; let's not allow it to take over us, instead,  let's progress together with it. No matter how old you get, never stop learning something new. Be a student of life._

Jolly’s Homepage is a documentation of the learning I gained from IT5016 Software Development Fundamentals. A weekly reflection journal is created to train and practice my programming knowledge. At the same time monitor my progress while creating a reference for future use as I advance in my developing skills. This is also intended to be of help to aspiring developers who are just starting their journey. It’s my pleasure to pay it forward by sharing the mastery I have acquired and be part of your success in one way or another.

Please don’t hesitate to check out my weekly improvement and share with me your thoughts.
