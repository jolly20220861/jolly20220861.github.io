I used to say I'm too old for school but life seems so boring doing the same routine. My heart leads me back to where I am passionate about; not programming, not computers but what lies within; discovery and understanding. I realised that, as we age, we need to continue to improve and develop ourselves. Technology is the fu true; let's not allow it to take over us, instead,  let's progress together with it. No matter how old you get, never stop learning something new. Be a student of life.
