As defned in Oxford dictionary, it is a diagram showing the relation between variable quantities, typically of two variables, each measured along one of a pair of axes at right angles.

In today's corporate world, graph is widely used by big companies such as Google, Netflix and Facebook to be abe to know their customers better and provide suggestions and offers based on the user's preferences and past purchases. This process is called _**Knowledge Graph**_; a machine readable **representation of knowledge domain**, which can be read and processed by human as well as by **machines**.

## 🆁🅴🅵🅻🅴🅲🆃🅸🅾🅽:

Time flies! It's already the 4th week. One month nearly passed. I am surviving, treading in the water. I am slowly getting the hang of it. I read continue to read the module and did more research. Now I am starting to understand, " or ' is used for string which is alpha characters. I've learned that indentation is important in Python because it indicates the block of code. I am starting to enjoy and at the same time rack my brain which often made me lost in thoughts.

Today, we are learning something new again. That is good but I feel like everything is piling up. Hearing new terminologies such as DallE and block chain. I have new list to research. But, I can think of it later, I'd rather focus on the activity to give me a break.

Being the subject of a video made me self-conscious not only on how I will look on the video but also on the thought of "am I going to greatly contribute on the effectiveness of the video"? It also gave me awareness to observe on how people are reacting on the activity which made me notice my self-worth, that without me the project will not be possible for others and vise versa. It's a domino effect. I am afraid to ruin it that I was attached to my phone more than to my image.

In spite of it all, I loved the activity as it gave me confirmation of my decision to take the course. IT isn't my thing but I jumped in because I know that I have to learn to grow with the technology as it will already be part of our lives no matter what. Akin to the story that was shared, to survive, we have to understand not to resist but to go with the flow and observe on the things around us so we can see what we can grasp on to help us get through. I don't have a project yet in mind but I know sooner or later the idea will pop for I don't have to think of something different and great but, a simple graph around that will allow my creativity to work.
