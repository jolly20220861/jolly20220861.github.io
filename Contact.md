## Week 1: **Introduction**
### What is **Scratch**
**Scratch.mit** is an online programming language and community created by MIT Media Lab to help young people and beginners in programming to have a good jumpstart.
We used it on our first day to have a fun introduction with the activity called "Hello World".

It is a good way to understand how Object-Oriented_Programming **(OOP)** Python works.  It is because the **sprites** that are used to build in Scratch represents the objects in Python.  Scratc is an example of a visual programming which helped me understood how an object handles functions and data.

### What is Visual Programming?
**Visual Programming** is a programming language that uses graphical components and elements such as button, symbols and icons to develop a program. One of the examples is Scratch where you click and drag the available buttons to create a workflow of the program.

### What are some of the programming principles that you have discovered?
Below are some of the programming principles that I have discovered yet needs to be fully understood.
1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - don't use duplicate code, instead use **_Abstraction_**
     ** _It’s important not to abuse it, duplication is not for code, but for functionality._**
2. **Open Closed Design Principle** - “Classes, methods, or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification.”
      **_The key benefit of this design principle is that already tried and tested code is not touched which means they won’t break._**
3. **Encapsulate What CHanges** - the only constant thing in this world is _change_ they say, therefore, encapsulate the code you expect or suspect to be changed in the future. **_The benefit of this OOP Design principle is that It’s easy to test and maintain proper encapsulated code._**
4. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - there should not be more than one reason for a class to change, or a level should always handle single functionality.
     **_The key benefit of this principle is that it reduces coupling between the individual component of the software and Code._**
5. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Tmethods or functions which use superclass type must be able to work with the object of subclass without any issue.
      **_If a class has more functionality than subclass might not support some of the functionality and does violate LSP._**
      
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I am more than happy to share my first ever project. Check out my [Hello World in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/718084602).
