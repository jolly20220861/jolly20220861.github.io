## Week 3: Learning Python
![Python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110364984/184584200-b4419d95-5331-4654-89d5-cacacde941f8.jpg)

### What is Python?
Here is a definition from the Python website:
"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics."
Python has been around for 25 years and it has become the language of choice for many large organisations, including Google, Yahoo, and IBM because of its power, simplicity, and complete object model. In addition to other paradigms, Python also supports both procedural and object-oriented programming approaches.

### Reasons to Learn Python?
* Easy to read and learn.
* Big open source and has the newest trends
* User friendly for both the bginners and the experts
* Big libraries for many things; just about evrything
* Great for validating ideas

### What Can You Do with Python?

* **Web Development**  - You can create web applications with different levels of complexity.  Flask, Pyramid and Django are a few of the excellent Python web frameworks but there are a lot more.
* **Data Analysis** - Many data scientists opt for this language because of the excellent available libraries like data visualisation
* **Machine Learning** - Imagine if you can predict or analyse stocks or customer satisfaction then you can make a more guided business decision.  This is made possible with a wide array of library that implements machine learning algorithm.
* **Computer Vision** - You can create interesting things like face and colour detection with the use of Opencv and Python.
* **Game Development** - Earn while you play! Create a video game using Pygame module where you navigate Python when writing the game logic.
* **Web Scraping** - This is done when there are data from a website that you need to take data from but the site can't show the info because it has no API. Python is used to scrape data.
* **Script Writing** - Done when you want to automate repetitive kinds of stuff.
* **Browser Automation** - is the process of conducting operations on a web browser automatically such as posting a status on Facebook or opening a web browser.
* **GUI Development** - Develop a desktop app known as GUI Application using Python

_*All you need is the desire and the willingness to learn_*

## BUILT-IN DATA TYPES

|**CATEGORY**     | **NAME**       |**DESCRIPTION**|
|:---             |:---            |:---           |
|                 |                |               |
|**None**         | None           | It is a **_null_** object|
|**Numeric**      | int            | This is an **_integer_** dta type.|
|                 | float          | This data type can store a **_floating-point_** number (ie. 1.5)|
|                 | complex        | It stores **complex** number; written in the form , **_x+yj_**, where x is the real part and y is the imaginary part|
|                 | bool           | a **Boolean** type which returns to **_true_** or **_False_**
|**Sequences**    | str            | use to store a string of **_alpha_** characters
|                 | liXst          | can store a list of **_arbitrary objects_**.|
|                 | Tuple          | can store a group of arbitrary items **_in order_** and **_unchangeable_**.
|                 | range          | use to create a **_range of integers_**; returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.|
|**Mapping**      | dict           | a dictionary data type that stores data in **_key:value pairs_**.|
|                 | set            | a **_mutable_** (can be changed) and **_unordered_** collection of unique items.|
|                 | frozenset      | collection of unique items that are **_immutable_** (unchangeable).


## Phyton Data Types

|**Example**     |**Data Type**|
|:---            |:------------|
|x = str("Hello World")|str|
|x = int(20)|int|
|x = float(20.5)|float|
|x = complex(1j)|complex|
|x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))|list|
|x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))|tuple|
|x = range(6)|range|
|x = dict(name="John", age=36|dict
|x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))|set|
|x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))|frozenset|
|x = bool(5)|bool|
|x = byte(5)|bytes|
|x = bytearray(5)|bytearray|
|x = memoryview(bytes(5))|memoryview|
