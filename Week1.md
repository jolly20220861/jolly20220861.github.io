## Week 1: **Introduction**
### What is ![scratch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110364984/183288625-2ac3bef0-b260-4179-b07d-f7016ae0540a.jpg)

**Scratch.mit** is an online programming language and community created by MIT Media Lab to help young people and beginners in programming to have a good jumpstart. We used it on our first day to have a fun introduction with the activity called “Hello World”.

It is a good way to understand how Object-Oriented_Programming **(OOP)** Python works. It is because the sprites that are used to build in Scratch represent the objects in Python. Scratch is an example of visual programming which helped me understand how an object handles functions and data.

### What is Visual Programming?
**Visual Programming** is a programming language that uses graphical components and elements such as buttons, symbols and icons to develop a program. One of the examples is Scratch where you click and drag the available buttons to create a workflow of the program.

### What are some of the programming principles that you have discovered?
Below are some of the programming principles that I have discovered yet need to be fully understood.
1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** -  don’t use duplicate code, instead **_Abstraction_**
     ** _It’s important not to abuse it, duplication is not for code, but for functionality._**
2. **Open Closed Design Principle** - “Classes, methods, or functions should be Open for extension (new functionality) and Closed for modification.”
      **_The key benefit of this design principle is that already tried and tested code is not touched which means it won’t break._**
3. **Encapsulate What CHanges** - the only constant thing in this world is the word _change_ they say, therefore, encapsulate the code you expect or suspect to be changed in the future. **_The benefit of this OOP Design principle is that It’s easy to test and maintain proper encapsulated code._**
4. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - there should not be more than one reason for a class to change, or a level should always handle single functionality.
     **_The key benefit of this principle is that it reduces coupling between the individual component of the software and the Code._**
5. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - methods or functions which use superclass type must be able to work with the object of subclass without any issue.
      **_If a class has more functionality than subclass might not support some of the functionality and does violate LSP._**
      
### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
I am more than happy to share my first-ever project. Check out my [Hello World in Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/718084602).
